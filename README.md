# Botzilla
An IRC Bot made in Java

So this is basically just a base IRC bot alongside a basic one I made as an example.
You should be able to simlpy extend the base and be able to easily implement your own logic for your IRC bot.

It should be compatible with any channel, it has proper PingPong mechanism, registers successfully, so on.
All that must be done is whatever methods need implementing.




This code is licensed under the ABCN ("Anyone But Commander Nightshady") license.
Note that an additional exception to the license is added, forbidding use/redistribution of said content to his
trainees as well, but only when in a 5 mile radius from "Commander Nightshady" or while holding any sort of (video)conference/chat with him.

Note that this license will only be used as long as Commander Nightshady does not surrender the 13th Legion to Commander DarkZeno,
afterwards, all exceptions are cleared and basically WTFPL applies

if you need a copy of the rest of the license feel free to google it or something.
